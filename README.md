# Spotify-Data-Analysis

Today Data Analysis has become a major in businesses, research, metrological department and many other fields. The extracted information from the datasets helps make meaningful decisions, publish research papers, predict weather and many more. This Spotify Data Analysis Project video will teach you to perform exploratory data analysis using Python on music-related datasets. Spotify is the world's largest audio streaming platform with various features, including sharing songs freely and viewing the lyrics while playing the songs. I have analyzed, visualized and drawn insights with Python libraries and functions.

I have performed the Spotify Data Analysis using Google Colab. The datasets are downloaded from kaggle.
