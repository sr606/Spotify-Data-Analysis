Today Data Analysis has become a major in businesses, research, metrological department and many other fields. The extracted information from the datasets helps make meaningful decisions, publish research papers, predict weather and many more. This Spotify Data Analysis Project video will teach you to perform exploratory data analysis using Python on music-related datasets. Spotify is the world's largest audio streaming platform with various features, including sharing songs freely and viewing the lyrics while playing the songs. You will learn to analyze, visualize and draw insights with Python libraries and functions.
